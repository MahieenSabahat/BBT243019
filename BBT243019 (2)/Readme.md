## Overview
This C++ program checks if an integer entered by the user is positive or negative. The user is prompted to input an integer (`number`). The program then evaluates the integer and prints "The number is Positive." if it is greater than zero, or "The number is Negative." if it is zero or less.



### Test Case 1
**Input:**
```
Enter an integer: 5
```
**Output:**
```
The number is Positive.
```

### Test Case 2
**Input:**
```
Enter an integer: -3
```
**Output:**
```
The number is Negative.
```
